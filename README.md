# STONE x PAPER x SCISSORS
The code for Stone-Paper-Scissors game by me in C.
<div>So, as you may know the rules.</div> 
<ul>
  <li>There are two players</li>
  <li>Each player simultaneously choices either stone, paper or scissors for each turn</li>
  <li>The player earns a point under 3-conditions,
    <ol>
      <li>Supposed - Stone X Opponent - Scissors</li>
      <li>Supposed - Paper X Opponent - Stone</li>
      <li>Supposed - Scissors X Opponent - Paper</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>If both choose alike then there's no point for either of them and game continous</li>
  <li>Till the first to score 3-points is the WINNER.</li>
</ul>

<div>These components can be displayed through hand sign,</div>
<ul>
  <li>STONE - Make a Fist.</li>
  <li>Paper - Make a High-five.</li>
  <li>Scissors - Your Index, Middle finger open and rest all closed.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a .c-file attached where you can find the code copy </p>
